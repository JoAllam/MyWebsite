                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>Yusuf Allam (first and last name, there are a lot of names in between). 
                        17 years old. A high school student and some of my hobbies are chess, anime, video games and listening to music. 
                        Your average teen :) . I am interested in STEM subjects especially Physics, Technology and Math. One thing I like that these subjects have in common is logic. 
                        This increases in programming. Every action and error has a reason and everything I do has a direct impact. 
                        I liked how in control I feel while I am coding. The fact that I am responsible for everything and every error that happens in my code.
                        <br>And accordingly, I started improving in this field. My school was the perfect environment for such improvements.
                        Surrounded with like-minded students filled with dedication and competitiveness. A community with supportive and fun friends is what helped me thrive.

                    <h2>School</h2>
                    <p>Currently in grade 11 in Red Sea STEM high school. One of a few special public high schools in Egypt with intense focus on STEM subjects.
                        A boarding school, university-like system with presentations, tasks, laptops and a capstone project each semester.
                        The school had a difficult and stressful environment but helped us improve and gain valuable skills.
                        <br>Additionally, there were student-made school clubs in various subjects. I am currently an active member of the Fablab club - Robotics Branch and the Programming club - Competitive Programming Branch.
                        I didn't join the Web Development branch because I already learned what they were teaching and I wanted to increase my critical thinking by practicing competitive programming.

                    <h2>Web and programming</h2>
                    <p>I have always been a computer lover. First started with playing video games and surfing the web. As time passed by I started to wonder how these things actually work.
                        Started learning HTML & CSS. Of course, I learned later that they are not programming languages but it was the first step in learning about code and how the web works.
                        Later on, learned some JS. <br>Also learned the basics of Python and C++ to get a better grasp of programming basics.
                        Joined DECI (Digital Egyptian Cubs Initiative) and dived more into Web Development, Front-End Development at first. Finished Level 2 (Basic Introduction into all tech fields),
                        Level 3: Web Development (Chose a path to specialize in, learned the basics.) and currently wrapping up Level 4: Web Development (Dived deeper into more complex concepts.)
                        <br>At the moment, I am skilled at HTML, CSS and client-side JS. Recently took a glimpse of some Back-End like NodeJS, Back-End frameworks like Express, and Libraries.
                        <br>I have always found it fascinating how I could write a few lines of code and have an immediate result in form of a webpage in front of me. And a few fields provided this thrill like Web Development.
                        The goal is to always improve and learn something new and what I lack most is experience. Therefore, I am practicing my skills and building projects. And my first real project is this personal website.
